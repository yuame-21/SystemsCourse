## Host 1: [NAME]

- CPU: 
- Cores: 
- Cache size (if known):
- RAM:

- OS: 

### Input data

*Briefly describe how large your data set is and how you created it. Also include how long `msort` took to sort it.*

### Experiments

*Replace X, Y, Z with the number of threads used in each experiment set.*

#### X Threads

Command used to run experiment: ``

Sorting portion timings:

1. ______ seconds
2. ______ seconds
3. ______ seconds
4. ______ seconds

#### Y Threads

Command used to run experiment: ``

Sorting portion timings:

1. ______ seconds
2. ______ seconds
3. ______ seconds
4. ______ seconds

#### Z Threads

Command used to run experiment: ``

Sorting portion timings:

1. ______ seconds
2. ______ seconds
3. ______ seconds
4. ______ seconds

*repeat sections as needed*

## Host 2: [NAME]

*use Host 1 template to fill this section*


## Observations and Conclusions

*Reflect on the experiment results and the optimal number of threads for your concurrent merge sort implementation on different hosts or platforms. Try to explain why the performance stops improving or even starts deteriorating at certain thread counts.*
